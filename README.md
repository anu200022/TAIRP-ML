# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains various machine learning tasks implemented in Jupyter notebooks. Here's a brief overview of each task:

1. **Fruit Image Classification**: This notebook contains the implementation of a machine learning model that classifies different types of fruits based on their images.

2. **Iris Flower Classification**: This notebook demonstrates the classification of Iris flowers into different species using various features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

3. **Titanic Survival Prediction**: This notebook explores the famous Titanic dataset and uses machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

4. **Image Captioning**: This notebook presents an image captioning model that generates descriptive captions for images.

5. **Stock Price Prediction**: This notebook implements a machine learning model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

6. **Movie Recommendation System**: This notebook builds a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their past viewing history.

Please refer to each individual notebook for detailed implementation and discussion. Enjoy exploring!
